## About
This GitHub Action automates the process of building, converting, and uploading _Conda_ packages to [Anaconda.org]. It streamlines package distribution by handling:

- Building: Uses `conda build` to create _Conda_ packages from a [_conda-build_ recipe][conda-build-recipe].
- Converting: Utilizes `conda convert` to generate platform-specific package variants.
- Uploading: Publishes the final package versions to [Anaconda.org] for easy distribution.

By integrating this action into your [CI/CD GitHub workflow][GitHub workflow], you can ensure that your _Conda_ packages are consistently built, transformed for multiple platforms, and made available to your users with minimal manual effort.

This GitHub Action was originally developed by the [Computational Biology and Drug Design Research Unit (UIBCDF) at the
Mexico City Children's Hospital Federico GÃ³mez][UIBCDF]. For the complete list of contributors, refer to the [contributors section](https://github.com/uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages/graphs/contributors).<br>
Explore more GitHub Actions developed by UIBCDF at the [UIBCDF GitHub Organization page](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agithub-actions+org%3Auibcdf&type=Repositories).

## Requirements

### Conda-build recipe
A [conda-build recipe][conda-build-recipe] defines the instructions for building your package, primarily through a `meta.yaml` file, optionally accompanied by other supporting files.<br>
These files can be placed within a `.conda` directory in your repository.<br>
For details on how to structure a conda-build recipe, refer to the [_Conda_ metadata instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html).

### Conda base environment
This action relies on `conda` commands, which must be accessible within the GitHub runner. To ensure this, a base [_Conda_ environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually) needs to be set up.<br>
We recommend using the [conda-incubator/setup-miniconda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda) action in a preceding step of your GitHub workflow to configure the _Conda_ base environment:

```yaml
steps:
      ...
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
        with:
          python-version: 
          environment-file: path/to/conda/env.yaml # Path to the conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      ...      
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v2.0.0
        ...
```

### Anaconda token

In order to upload a package to your anaconda user or organization channel, you need to [create an Anaconda token](https://docs.anaconda.com/anacondaorg/user-guide/work-with-accounts/#generating-tokens).<br>

#### Create an Anaconda token
There are two main ways to create an Anaconda token:
- [Using the command line](#using-the-command-line)
- [Through the Anaconda.org website](#through-the-anacondaorg-website)
  
##### Using the command line
You can create an Anaconda token from your terminal, using [anaconda auth](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-repository/commandreference/#authentication):
```
# Replace 'MyToken' with the name you want for your token
anaconda auth --create --name MyToken
```
> [!TIP]
> To create token for an [Anaconda Organization](https://docs.anaconda.com/anacondaorg/user-guide/work-with-organizations/), add the `--org` option to the command above:
> ```
> # Replace 'MyOrg' with the name of the organization
> # Replace 'MyToken' with the name you want for your token
> anaconda auth --create --name MyToken --org MyOrg
> ```

##### Through the Anaconda.org website
1. Log in to [Anaconda.org]
2. From your profile in the top-right corner, select **Settings**.
3. Click **Access** in the left-hand menu.
4. Fill out the _Create access token_ form:
   1. Provide a unique token name.
   2. Set your token strength to `strong (longer token)`. This generates a strong, completely unique token that is difficult to guess with brute force methods.
   3. Set the required scopes for your use case.
   4. Set the expiration date.
5. Click on _Create_

<img src="create_token.png" alt="create token" width="60%">

> [!TIP]
> To create a token for an [Anaconda Organization](https://docs.anaconda.com/anacondaorg/user-guide/work-with-organizations/), follow the steps outlined in [Issuing/reissuing a token](https://docs.anaconda.com/psm-cloud/tokens/#issuing-reissuing-a-token).

#### Add the Anaconda token to the GitHub Secrets
The best practice for using an Anaconda token in a GitHub Action is to store it as a [GitHub Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). This helps keep the token secure and prevents it from being exposed in workflow logs.<br>
For instructions on creating and using GitHub Secrets, refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

## How to use

You can include this GitHub Action as a [step](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps) within a [GitHub workflow], placed in the `.github/workflows` directory within your repository.

An example of the basic usage of this GitHub Action is displayed below:

### Additional command line arguments
This action, internally, calls the following commands:
- [`conda build`][conda-build-command] (or `conda mambabuild`, if `mambabuild` is set to `true`)
- [`conda convert`][conda-convert-command] (if any platform conversion is specified)
- [`anaconda upload`][anaconda-upload-command] (if `upload` is set to `true`)

The above commands have multiple command-line arguments that can be passed, for each of the respective command, by using the `conda_build_args`, `conda_convert_args` and `anaconda_upload_args` input parameters.

Refer to the [Pass additional command-line arguments example](#pass-additional-command-line-arguments-example) for a practical case on the usage of these input parameters.

> [!WARNING]
> Some command line arguments in `conda_build_args`, `conda_convert_args` or `anaconda_upload_args` cannot be specified because they are either already handled internally by the action or conflict with specific input parameters:<br>
> **`conda_build_args`**
> - `--output-folder`
> - `--no-anaconda-upload`
> 
> **`conda_convert_args`**
> - `--output-folder`
> 
> **`anaconda_upload_args`**
> - `--label`/`-l` together with the `label` input parameter
> - `--user`/`-u` together with the `user` input parameter

## Outputs
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| paths | Space-separated paths for the built packages, in the format `path1 path2 ... pathN`. |

The output paths can be useful for later jobs, for example to [create a GitHub release with the built packages as assets](#create-a-github-release-with-the-built-packages-as-assets-example).

## Examples

<!-- Example 1 -->
<details id="build-and-upload-a-package-when-a-new-git-tag-is-pushed-and-use-the-git-tag-as-the-package-version-example">
<summary><b>Example 1: Build and upload a package when a new <i>Git</i> tag is pushed and use the <i>Git</i> tag as the package version</b></summary>

The `meta.yaml` file defines the [package version field](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html#package-version) to specify the version number of the built package.

To automatically set the package version to the latest <i>Git</i> tag, [Jinja Templating](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html#templating-with-jinja) can be used by setting the version value to `{{ GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG }}` in the `meta.yaml` file:

```yaml
# meta.yaml file
package:
  name: your_package_name # replace with your package name
  version: {{ GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG }}
```

Then, to build and upload a package whenever a new <i>Git</i> tag is pushed, your workflow yaml file can look like the following:

```yaml
# your_worfklow.yaml file
name: Build and upload conda packages when a tag gets pushed

on:
  push:
    tags: 
      - '*'

jobs:
  conda_deployment:
    name: Conda deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-tags: true
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.11
          environment-file: path/to/conda/env.yaml    # Replace with the path to your conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v2.0.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: path/to/meta.yaml/directory # Replace with the path to your meta.yaml directory
          user: uibcdf # Replace with your Anaconda username (or an Anaconda organization username)
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the name of your Anaconda Token secret
```

**:bulb:TIP**<br>
Version numbers including the dash character `-` are [not supported by conda-build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#package-version). If you want to release a version like `1.0.0-beta.1`, replace it with something like `1.0.0b1`.
</details>

<!-- Example 2 -->
<details id="build-a-pure-python-conda-package-for-different-platforms-example">
<summary><b>Example 2: Build a <i>pure Python</i> conda package for different platforms</b></summary>

When a package is built as pure Python library, `conda convert` can generate [packages for other platforms](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html?highlight=platform#optional-converting-conda-package-for-other-platforms).

To create packages for multiple platforms (such as 'linux-64', 'osx-64' and 'win-64`), you can use the following workflow:

```yaml
# your_worfklow.yaml file
name: Build and upload pure-python conda package for different platforms

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  conda_deployment:

      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3

          user: uibcdf # Replace with your Anaconda username (or an Anaconda organization username)
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the name of your Anaconda Token secret
          platform_linux-64: true
          platform_osx-64: true
          platform_win-64: true
```
</details>

<!-- Example 3 -->
<details id="build-a-platform-specific-conda-package-for-different-platforms-example">
<summary><b>Example 3: Build a platform-specific conda package for different platforms</b></summary>

If a package requires platform-specific compilation instructions, `conda convert` is not a viable option.

Instead, the package can be built separately for each target platform by running multiple _Conda_ builds in parallel using the [GitHub matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/running-variations-of-jobs-in-a-workflow):

```yaml
# your_worfklow.yaml file
name: Build and upload platform-specific conda packages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  conda_deployment:
    name: Conda deployment
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.11
          environment-file: path/to/conda/env.yaml    # Replace with the path to your conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v2.0.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: path/to/meta.yaml/directory # Replace with the path to your meta.yaml directory
          user: uibcdf # Replace with your Anaconda username (or an Anaconda organization username)
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the name of your Anaconda Token secret
```

This setup will run three jobs in parallel, building and uploading the Conda package for the `macos-latest`, `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` platforms.

**:bulb:TIP**<br>
In this case, your `meta.yaml` file will likely need [preprocessing selectors](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#preprocessing-selectors) to differenciate builds across platforms.
</details>

<!-- Example 4 -->
<details id="pass-additional-command-line-arguments-example">
<summary><b>Example 4: Pass additional command-line arguments</b></summary>

[Additional command-line arguments](#additional-command-line-arguments) can be passed to the `conda build`, `conda convert` and `anaconda upload` commands, internally called within this action. 

For example, to build a package and limit the search for dependencies to specific Anaconda channels, the `--override-channels` and `--channel my_channel` options can be passed to the to the [conda build][conda-build-command] command.

Additionally, to display _Python_ imports for the compiled components of the built package, the `--show-imports` option can be passed to the [conda convert][conda-convert-command] command.

To apply these options when building and uploading a package, you can use the following workflow:

```yaml
# your_worfklow.yaml file
name: Build and upload conda packages with specific Anaconda channels and showing Python imports

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  conda_deployment:
    name: Conda deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.11
          environment-file: path/to/conda/env.yaml    # Replace with the path to your conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v2.0.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: path/to/meta.yaml/directory # Replace with the path to your meta.yaml directory
          user: uibcdf # Replace with your Anaconda username (or an Anaconda organization username)
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the name of your Anaconda Token secret
          platform_osx-64: true
          conda_build_args: --override-chanels --channel my_channel # Replace my_channel with the name of the specific channel
          conda_convert_args: --show-imports
```
</details>

<!-- Example 5 -->
<details id="build-a-package-for-multiple-python-versions-example">
<summary><b>Example 5: Build a package for multiple <i>Python</i> versions</b></summary>

The recommended approach for building packages across different _Python_ versions is to use [build variants](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/variants.html#build-variants).

This involves placing a `conda_build_config.yaml` file inside the conda recipe directory, specifying variant inputs. `conda build` will then generate a separate build for each variant.

For example, to build a package for _Python_ `2.7` and `3.5`, we can define:

```yaml
# conda_build_config.yaml file
python:
    - 2.7
    - 3.5
```

```yaml
# meta.yaml file
...
package:
    name: your_package_name # Replace with your package name
    version: package_version # Replace with your package version

requirements:
    build:
        - python
    run:
        - python
...
```

In this case, no changes are needed in the workflow file for this action. A setup similar to the [basic example](#how-to-use) will work.

<summary><b>Example 8: Test correctness of a <i>Conda</i> build</b></summary>

You can use this action in a [CI/CD workflow](https://github.com/resources/articles/devops/ci-cd) to test for errors during the conda build and conversion process, without uploading the package to Anaconda.org.

To do this, set `upload: false` as an input parameter for the action:

```yaml
name: Test conda build

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: main

jobs:
  conda_deployment:
    name: Conda deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.11
          environment-file: path/to/conda/env.yaml    # Replace with the path to your conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v2.0.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: path/to/meta.yaml/directory # Replace with the path to your meta.yaml directory
          user: uibcdf # Replace with your Anaconda username (or an Anaconda organization username)
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the name of your Anaconda Token secret
          upload: false
```

<summary><b>Example 9: Force upload of a <i>Conda</i> package</b></summary>

To force the package upload to Anaconda.org regardless of errors (within the `anaconda upload` command), we can pass the additional [`--force` command-line argument](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-repository/commandreference/#upload:~:text=%2D%2Dforce%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Force%20a%20package%20upload%20regardless%20of%20errors) as a `anaconda_upload_args`:

```yaml
name: Build and upload conda packages (force upload)

on:
  push:
    branches: main

jobs:
  conda_deployment:
    name: Conda deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.11

          auto-update-conda: false
